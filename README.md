# ROCK-PAPER-SCISSOR-GAME
Created an interactive Rock Paper Scissors game with a user-friendly interface using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. Implemented JavaScript to handle the game logic, allowing users to select Rock, Paper, or Scissors. The script processes user input, generates the computer's random choice, and displays the outcome in real-time.
